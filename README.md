### Built With 
[![React][React.js]][React-url]

<!-- FEATURES -->
### Features

1. Basic calculation with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations
<p align="center">
<img width="441" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50744056/226800016-d2e6fcc7-3dd6-4fa8-9e28-424c3ba2fb69.png">
</p>

* Usage tips:
  * We support single operation as well as chain of operations.
  * To calculate a chain of operations, simply input the next operators after getting the result of the previous operation on the result screen. 
  * The result of the previous operation will be used as the first operand in the next operation
  * The result of the operation is calculated at the time the next operator or the equal operator is selected
    * As a result, operators precedence is not supported in this version of the application (that could be supported if we implement parenthesis operators)
   
2. Toggle between negative and positive numbers
<p align="center">
  <img width="435" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50744056/226800265-c0fcef20-5ba1-4e63-8333-77512e095531.png">
</p>

* Usage tips:
  * Use this key to toggle between positive and negative number after entering any operands
  * If you toggle this key before inputting the second operand (which means just after entering the operator), it will apply the logic to the first operand and use it as the second operand for the operation.

3. Calulation with decimal numbers
<p align="center">
  <img width="433" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50744056/226800555-c1dd3f28-366a-4777-83a1-4eddde8ac52a.png">
</p>

* Usage tips:
  * Use this key before entering the decimal part of a operand
  * We provide a shortcut that if you don't enter the whole part first, the whole part will be assumed to be the zero number.
  * We round the result of all operations with decimal numbers upto 8 numbers after the decimal point.

4. Clear the most recent entry
<p align="center">
  <img width="436" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50744056/226800793-44f7f2fb-7c5f-4162-950a-c555c832a650.png">
</p>
* Usage tips:
  * Using this feature don't affect the existing calculation history.
  * You could use this key to clear the most recent input entry (which could be either operand or operator)
  * We only support clearing the most recent entry, which means after selecting this key, it will be changed from C to AC, that only allows you to reset the current calculation.

5. Clear all entries
<p align="center">
  <img width="435" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50744056/226801068-7c139ea0-bf3a-4e61-8598-67fcac8b943d.png">
</p>

* Usage tips:
  * Using this feature don't affect the existing calculation history.
  * This key will appear after using the `Clear the most recent entry` feature
  * Selecting the key multiple times does't change its behaviour. 

6. Toggle showing calculation history
<p align="center">
  <img width="841" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50744056/226801160-ccfb626b-40c1-4422-97be-05e1819d2ffb.png">
</p>

* Usage tips:
  * Use this key to toggle showing all the calculation history.
